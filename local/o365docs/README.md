# Office 365 Integration Documentation

This plugin is not part of the Office 365 suite of plugins for Moodle. This plugin only serves as a place to store documentation and associated resources in the repository. Developers submit changes to this documentation as features are added or modified, and this documention is synced out to our live documentation on the MoodleDocs at each release.

Documentation is formatted as separate plugin here for three reasons:

1. Keep documentation in the git repository to allow documentation changes to be included with code changes.
2. Formatted as a plugin to still allow this repository to be installed on top of a Moodle site
3. Kept separate from the functional plugins to avoid bloating them with documentation and images.
